You are going to use this version as a base for the Color Palette Designer(a later assignment), with five different colors, all displaying the same kind of info, so the more you can re-use, the better. That goes for HTML, CSS as well as JavaScript.

The color must continually change as the users selects different colors. (Note that Chrome on Windows might have a problem with that, if so choose another browser)
The selected color must be displayed as:

- a color
- HEX code
- RGB values
- HSL values
